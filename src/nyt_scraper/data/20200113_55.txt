Quentin Tarantino’s evocation of 1969 Los Angeles clings to an era it doesn’t want to end, even if it has to rewrite history a little to do it. With the story of a fading western star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his trusty stunt double (Brad Pitt), Tarantino accesses the period through a side door, allowing him the space to cruise top-down through the streets, hang out on Hollywood sound stages and follow the actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) in the blissful days before the Manson family goes to Cielo Drive.

A family of penniless con artists infiltrates the lives of a much wealthier family in Bong Joon Ho’s genre-straddling mix of dark comedy, nerve-jangling suspense and incisive social commentary. The less known about the intricacies of the plot going in, the better, since Bong has nested the many twists so meticulously. But as the two families grow more closely intertwined, their fates are tied up in duplicity, an uneasy tension between classes and one very big secret that’s primed to detonate.

Based on Charles Brandt’s book “I Heard You Paint Houses,” the movie is about Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), who claims to have worked as a hit man for the Bufalino crime family, and to have been responsible for the unsolved disappearance of the former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Yet the dubious facts of Sheeran’s “confession” are folded into a uniquely meditative Martin Scorsese gangster epic, which slows the metabolism of films like “Goodfellas” and “Casino” to reflect on death and the consequences of a sinful life.

Standing in stark contrast to the bright, can-do heroism of the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and going down a darker road than even its DC brethren, like the Christopher Nolan “Batman” series — “Joker” frames a villain’s origins as a grimy tale of urban alienation. As Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Joaquin Phoenix more or less slaps clown makeup on Travis Bickle from “Taxi Driver,” though the director Todd Phillips lays some of the blame for Fleck’s psychosis on a broken social system.

Thirty years after “Kramer vs. Kramer” won best picture, the writer-director Noah Baumbach gets into the excruciating particulars of divorce, especially when child custody is at stake. Adam Driver stars as a New York theater director who’s left reeling when his wife (Scarlett Johansson), an actress trying to resume her Hollywood career, hires a skilled attorney (Laura Dern) and works to resettle their 8-year-old son in Los Angeles. The process gets uglier from there, but Baumbach cushions the blows with humor and sneaky optimism.

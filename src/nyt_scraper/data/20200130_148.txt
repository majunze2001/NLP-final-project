Judge John Hodgman on Whether Exercise Is ‘Me Time’
Jeff writes: My wife calls jogging my “me time,” even though I get up at 5 a.m. to do it. Usually my family is asleep when I leave. But I get the stink eye if our kids wake up before I get home. Still, I think of “me time” as reading or having a beer and watching TV — not exercise.
Who else’s time could it possibly be? It’s your hobby. If you were getting up at 5 and ignoring your kids to do jigsaw puzzles or work on your Iron Man rig for Comic Con, I trust you would have the grace to accept the stink eye you deserve. Running has obvious physical and mental health benefits, but so does my hobby — napping — and it’s just as solitary. True, your wife may prefer your physique to mine; but she also desires your body in other ways, such as in the house more. So do keep jogging. You deserve your me time! But don’t fool yourself. Jogging is just as much a hobby as cosplay, only it’s somehow even sweatier.

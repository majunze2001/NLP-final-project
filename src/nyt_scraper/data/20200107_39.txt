‘System K’ Review: Art in the Streets of Desperation
Conventional wisdom holds that new movie releases of January are dogs. That’s arguably true everywhere. Except in New York art houses. For instance, this week Film Forum unveils “System K,” a lively, cogent, unsettling documentary about the incredible art world roiling in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The director, Renaud Barret, situates his film in the here and now that presents itself to his camera — the movie doesn’t delve into the root causes of the poverty and oppression that make the country a pressure cooker. Instead, he follows the artists who have no choice but to live in it. “Our work feeds on chaos,” says Freddy Tsimba, a sculptor who assembles his work out of bottle caps, trash, machetes, and pretty much everything and anything he can amass in large quantities.
No lofts or studios for the multidisciplinary creators depicted here. They make their works in spaces that are at least semi-exposed. In some cases, as in that of Kongo Astronaut, a performance artist who walks Kinshasa’s streets in a makeshift spacesuit, they are the work.
“I know I may end up being sick eventually,” says Géraldine Tobe, who, like many of the artists in this film, works with melted plastic and other materials that are potentially toxic. At the movie’s end, one artist, who is rolled through the streets in a tub full of animal blood, raises such concerns even more explicitly.
Barret makes the viewer understand, implicitly at least, the desperation of these creators, even as views of their work, and the simmering electronic Afro-funk of the soundtrack, make a case for the indomitability of their creative impulse.

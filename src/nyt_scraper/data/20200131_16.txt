‘F9’ Trailer: Here’s Your First Look at the Latest ‘Fast & Furious’ Movie
Last year, “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw” got a jump on its Super Bowl movie-ad competitors, releasing a trailer on the Friday before the NFL championship game. The movie went on to gross more than $750 million worldwide.
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The next film in the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “F9: The Fast Saga,” has unleashed its first promo two days before this year’s Super Bowl. This one doesn’t feature Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) or Shaw (Jason Statham), but Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto, a reformed criminal and ex-street racer who has settled into retirement with his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), and their young son, Brian — named after the late co-star Paul Walker’s character.
Perhaps trying to make up for the absence of Johnson, “F9” has recruited another wrestler-actor, John Cena, to join the cast as Jakob, Dominic’s younger brother. Described as a master thief, an assassin and a high-performance driver, he’s sent by the cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron) to kill his sibling.
Also added to the ensemble are a pair of musicians, the reggaeton star Ozuna and rapper Cardi B, as yet-to-be-disclosed characters. The trailer does contain one major reveal, though: Sung Kang reprises his role as Han Lue, a driver who had apparently died in the 2006 “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.”
Directed by Justin Lin (returning to the series for the first time since “Fast & Furious 6” in 2013), “F9: The Fast Saga” hits theaters on May 22.
